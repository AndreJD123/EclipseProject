# EclipseProject
Banking ATM Assignment
The project I was working on, was to make my own banking atm
machine using Eclipse IDE.
• My machine was set up with a fee and overdraft method.
• A deposit and withdraw system.
• I also set up multiple secure features and added defensive
programming techniques.
This was for my Spring 2021 CSS 1035 Secure Software Development Class
