# EclipseProject
Banking ATM Assignment
The project I was working on was to create a banking atm
machine using Eclipse IDE.
• The machine was set up with a fee and overdraft method.
• A deposit and withdraw system.
• I also set up multiple secure features and added defensive programming techniques.
• Applied cryptographic constructions to ensure the confidentiality of data
• Used defensive principles of input validation and output encoding

This was for my Fall 2021 CSS 1035 Secure Software Development Class.
